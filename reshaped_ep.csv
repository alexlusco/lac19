Ethiopia,Emergency powers,Suspension/postponement of elections,"Postponed (the sixth general elections (elections to Parliament and state councils), which were scheduled for August 2020, were postponed after the NEBE declared that it would not be able to administer free and fair elections within the context of Covid-19. It became apparent elections could not be held before the expiry of the terms of Parliament and the state councils on 5 October 2020 when the Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency. This gave rise to the constitutional issues of whether elections could be postponed and who would govern at the federal and state level after the expiry of the terms of Parliament and the state councils. The HPR requested the intervention of the HoF in settling this constitutional matter, since the latter is the constitutional umpire of the federation. The HoF, as per the recommendation of the Commission Council of Constitutional of Inquiry (CCI) which assists the HoF in resolving constitutional issues, decided that the sixth general elections should be postponed until such time that the HPR, based on the advice of the MoH, decided that Covid-19 is no longer a public health threat. The elections would be held within a year after HPR so decides. In the meantime, Parliament,  and state councils, and federal and state executives would continue governing. It should be noted though that the Covid-19 was not the sole reason for the postponement of the elections. The political crisis that began after the 2015 elections which, until even today, continues in one form or another was perhaps the key factor for the postponement of the elections.

The court additionally ruled that the by-elections could be held beyond the 90-day legislated period for the filling of councillor vacancies but not beyond 120 days from the date of the order. However, the prolonged state of national disaster required the court to further postpone the by-elections twice and to revise the electoral timetable for the by-elections accordingly. After consultations with the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and a special National Party Liaison Committee representing political parties, the IEC resolved ‘to clear the backlog of all outstanding by-elections on 11 November 2020’.

United Kingdom,Emergency powers,Suspension/postponement of elections,"Postponed (the Electoral Commission, an independent body, wrote to the UK Government on 10 March 2020 asking that local and other elections in England and Wales be suspended on health grounds for both members of the general public and for polling station staff. Section 60 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 postpones ‘7 May Elections’ (ie local government elections, Mayor of London and London Assembly elections, elected mayors of local and combined authorities, and police and crime commissioners) to the same or near date the following year. It ultimately postponed local elections due for 118 councils, mayoral and some assembly elections in the Greater London Assembly, and a variety of other elections. Some local referendums and council by-elections were also cancelled. The 2020 Act also deals with by-elections to various assemblies (section 61), and postpones elections under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 (section 62). The Government confirmed in February 2021 that scheduled local government elections in May 2021 would be proceeding, with advice to use postal and proxy voting where possible. The 2020 Act did not affect scheduled elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Parliament due on 6 May 2021, which are due to go ahead as planned) [Part III.D].",https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law-occ19/law-occ19-e17#law-occ19-e17-div2-9

That ended the use of hybrid proceedings, though within 10 days the Government permitted the re-introduction of hybrid proceedings for scrutiny proceedings (ie oral questions and ministerial statements) but not substantive proceedings (eg legislative scrutiny): this has been criticised. The House of Lords, where the Government’s party holds no majority, quickly made provision for hybrid proceedings and online voting (through ‘PeerHub’), the latter of which commenced on 15 June 2020.

United States,Emergency powers,Type of parliamentary scrutiny (per instrument),"Depends on the state - in New York, for grandfathered orders, extensions past 60 days are barred until the Governor has responded to comments by relevant legislative committees chairs (made affirmative procedure). For new directives, legislative approval is needed ex ante (affirmative procedure). In Ohio, there is an made affirmative procedure. (NY: Directives issued pursuant to a disaster declaration were limited by statute to 30-day increments, subject to unilateral renewal for additional 30-day periods [Part III.A]. The New York legislature voted in March 2021 to terminate some of the expansive emergency powers it had authorized a little over a year earlier. The new legislation grandfathered in executive directives in effect at the time the new legislation was adopted by allowing them to stay in effect for 30 additional days and allowing the Governor to extend or modify them unilaterally for additional 30-day terms. Extension or modification of grandfathered orders requires a five-day notice-and-comment period unless the Governor certifies that extension is ‘necessary to address any exigent circumstances that address an imminent threat to public health or safety,’ and provides an opportunity for comment from legislative committee chairs ‘as soon as possible.’ Second or later extensions are barred until the Governor has responded to any comments provided by relevant legislative committee chairs and leaders of affected local governments. The newly amended statute prohibits the Governor from issuing any new ‘public health directive related to managing the covid pandemic’ without legislative approval. It also clarifies that the legislature can terminate an executive directive or order at any time via a concurrent resolution that is not subject to veto. In several other states, legislative bodies sought to limit executive authority. In early 2021, several state legislatures weighed measures that would authorize a small committee of legislators to overturn executive orders—rather than depending on the ordinary legislative process to do so. Other reforms, such as legislation adopted by the Ohio legislature after overriding the Governor’s veto on 24 March 2021, imposed strict time limits on emergency declarations by governors, with all measures subsequently lifted by default unless the legislature acts affirmatively to approve them [Part III.A].)",https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law-occ19/law-occ19-e24?prd=OCC19#law-occ19-e24-div2-6
